# sql_database_design
a personal project to turn a bunch of csv files into a relational database hosted locally with Postgres

This project offers a data engineering solution to my data analysis project https://github.com/ToninaP/data_analysis_portfolio

In the data analysis project I used python functions to clean and visualise data. But how to make these efforts sustainable? How to store data so it will be easy to query, to attach to the visualization engines?

Since data was stored and transformed locally, I offer another local solution: to encapsulate it in a local SQL database.
